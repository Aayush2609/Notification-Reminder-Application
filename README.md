# Notification-Reminder-Application
-----------------------------------------

No matter how well you set up your to-do list and calendar, you aren’t going to get things done unless you have a reliable way of reminding yourself to actually do them.

A lot of people resist getting better organized. No matter what kind of chaotic mess, their lives are on a day-to-day basis because they know themselves well enough to know that there’s after all that work, they’ll probably forget to take their lists with them when it matters most. 

So, this is the project made throughout to lend a helping hand to all those who need ‘Reminders’ to complete their tasks on time. I hope this project will enlighten all the technological requirements to build a ‘Notification Reminder Application’.

# Python Libraries
-----------------------------------------
In this project I have used several libraries: - 

1. Python GUI – tkinter
Python offers multiple options for developing GUI (Graphical User Interface). Out of all the GUI methods, tkinter is the most commonly used method. It is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. Python with tkinter is the fastest and easiest way to create the GUI applications.

2. Python: Pillow (a fork of PIL)
Python Imaging Library (expansion of PIL) is the de facto image processing package for Python language. It incorporates lightweight image processing tools that aids in editing, creating and saving images. Pillow supports a large number of image file formats including BMP, PNG, JPEG, and TIFF. 

3. Plyer
Plyer is an open-source library to access features commonly found in various platforms via python. Plyer module is used to access the features of the hardware. This module does not come built-in with Python. We need to install it externally using the following command: -
pip install plyer

# Python Modules
-----------------------------------------
1. Image - The Image module provides a class with the same name which is used to represent a PIL image. The module also provides functions to load images from files, and to create new images.

2. ImageTk - The ImageTk module contains support to create and modify Tkinter Bitmap Image and Photo Image objects from PIL images. 

3. Messagebox - The tkinter.messagebox module provides a template base class as well as a variety of convenience methods for commonly used configurations. The message boxes are modal and will return a subset of (True, False, OK, None, Yes, No) based on the user’s selection. 

4. Notification – It produces a notification message in form of a pop-up message on desktop. 

5. Time - This module works with the time object and is installed by default.
